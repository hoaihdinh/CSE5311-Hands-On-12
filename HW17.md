# Amoritized Runtime for Inserting n elements into a Dynamic Table

## a) Using the aggregate method

Cost of simple insert = O(1), no resize done

Occasional cost of insert with resizing = O(n) total (resize operation will be O(n), where n is the current size of the table)

In general, n inserts will result in about O(n) simple inserts along with some complex inserts 

The total complex inserts will be equal to $\sum_{i=0}^{\log_2(n)}$ (2^i) = 2(n-1) = O(n)

Thus the total resulting time is about O(n) + O(n) = O(n)

Take that and divide by n will end up with an amoritized cost  of O(n)/n = O(1) per insert

## b) Using the accounting method

A simple insert will cost $1.

A complex/expensive insert will cost $i, where i is when the expensive insert occurs (this is to relocate elements from the old array to the new one).

Overcharge the cheap operations, to then have leftover money for the more expensive operations. Let the charge of each simple insert be $3.

Then that means that after every simple insert, +$2 goes into the bank/reserve. Meaning that after 5 simple inserts, a total of $15 is charged, $5 is used to insert the item and the $10 is saved for later.

Say that the 6th insert is a complex insert, and the cost of that will be $6. Since we have $10 in the bank, subtracting from that will be suffice to pay. This is general overview, lets look at a more in depth analysis

In general, having each insert pay $3 will always maintain the balance to be >= $0. This means taht the amortized cost of inserts will be O(1)
