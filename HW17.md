# Amoritized Runtime for Inserting n elements into a Dynamic Table

## a) Using the aggregate method

Cost of simple insert = O(1), no resize done

Occasional cost of insert with resizing = O(n) total (resize operation will be O(n), where n is the current size of the table)

In general, n inserts will result in about O(n) simple inserts along with some complex inserts 

The total complex inserts will be equal to Sum(i=0 to log_2(n)) (2^i) = 2(n-1) = O(2n)

Thus the total resulting time is about O(n) + O(2n)

Take that and divide by n will end up with an amoritized cose of O(n)/n = O(1)

## b) Using the accounting method
